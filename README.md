# Washington wildfire 2015
## Author: Ryan Gan
## Date Created: December 28, 2016

Project code for 2015 Washington wildfires. Code in this project repository will be very similar to the washington_wildfire repository, which contains the project code for 2012. 

Once special note will be regarding the CHARS data. There was a change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 during this year. It may not be an issue because it happens after the wildfire season ends, but I will need to check.

## Notes:
